# MyFriendlyCalculator

Welcome to My Friendly Calculator!

This is my first C++ program containing the first lines of code I've written by memory - with a little bit of help from resources.
I started on August 13 and finished this on August 20, with 1-4 hours of study time per day.

This program taught me how to use the basics, which are the usage of variables and functions, the if/else statements, and the while loop.

As I continue my journey in learning more about programming and C++, I will be updating my 'calculator' versions.
