# MyFriendlyCalculator

Welcome to My Friendly Calculator!

This is my first C++ program containing the first lines of code I've written by memory - with a little bit of help from resources.
I started self-studying on August 13, 2020, and finished this on August 20, 2020, with 1-4 hours of study time per day.

This program taught me how to use the basics, which are the usage of variables and functions, the if/else statements, and the while loop.

The calculator has 2 versions: MyFriendlyCalculator and TheBetterFriendlyCalculator.

My Friendly Calculator
    This program shows the basics of printing and accepting input from user. My first lines of code ever!
    
The Better Friendly Calculator
    This program shows more basic principles that greatly improves the logic of the first one.

As I continue my journey in learning more about programming and C++, I will be updating my 'calculator' versions.
