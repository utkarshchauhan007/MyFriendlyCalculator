    I dont know how to get out of the loop.
    i have to make a loop from the idea that unless the result is a valid one, it will keep on looping
    so that means if the result is invalid, or it's an invalid operator, it will keep looping.
    but if it's answered correctly, it will stop the loop and move on to the next friendly conversation

    i finally did it. august 20, 2020
    figured out how to loop it well if the user did not enter the correct operator, and not loop it
    if it's answered. HA!
    BUT I FOUND MY FIRST BUG.
    so the program keeps on looping when a letter is entered into the system.

    I get why the program keeps on looping when a letter is entered into the program instead of a number.
    Because once the user inputs the letter, it's directly stored into the variable.
    The message shows up, the loop starts again.
    But since the default saved value inside the integer is a letter, before the loop starts,
    it automatically goes straight to else, and loops for infinity.
    I have to learn how to erase the wrong value before the loop restarts.
