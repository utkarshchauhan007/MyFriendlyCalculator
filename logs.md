    I get why the program keeps on looping when a letter is entered into the program instead of a number.
    Because once the user inputs the letter, it's directly stored into the variable.
    The message shows up, the loop starts again.
    But since the default saved value inside the integer is a letter, before the loop starts,
    it automatically goes straight to else, and loops for infinity.
    I have to learn how to erase the wrong value before the loop restarts.
